# ATak with Firebase
This is a build of the ATak for WebGL. The original can be found here:
https://github.com/AdrianWennberg/ATak/

The game can be played here:

The game of Tak is a beautiful game with very simple rules, but you need a few different board 
pieces to be able to play it. That is why I'm making this implementation, mostly for myself, 
but we'll see where it goes in the future.

The rules can be found here: http://cheapass.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TakWebRules.pdf
